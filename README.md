This is a package you can implement in your laravel project.
With it, you'll be able to send and follow information.
The intended use is as follow :

1. Subscribe to our main platform to view the data generated by this package
2. Install this package and use it where you feel the need (mainly in places where errors could occur)
3. Your instructions will create a "project" on the other end and log each and every of your interaction.
4. Do not hesitate to use the "emergency" tag when needed. So that for your in-prod project, you'll receive the logs AND an instant e-mail telling you what's going on.
5. Follow and track what's happening on your live projects on a single app.


Add this repo since it's not on packagist yet (but well, let me tell you, I don't recommend installing it yet since I'm just starting to making it lol)
```
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "type": "vcs",
      "url": "https://github.com/laPastequeWeb/report.git"
    }
  ]
}
```
Also, when installed, publish the config file :

REPORT_CLIENT_NAME="my customer"
REPORT_PROJECT="my customer's project"
REPORT_ACCESS_TOKEN="customer's access token"
REPORT_CLIENT_URL="customer's website/tool/SaaS url"
REPORT_DASHBOARD_URL="dashboard url (if custom)"

```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config-reporter
```

In your controller (or in your service provider if you want to use it eveywhere without specifying it)
```
use function Storhn\Reporter\Helpers\_report;
```
